        <p>Aside from coding, my biggest hobbies are automotive photography and working on cars with my friends. We often take our modified cars to a track day at Pocono Raceway and compare lap times.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy long hikes, bike rides along the shore, and playing with my dog at the park.</p>
